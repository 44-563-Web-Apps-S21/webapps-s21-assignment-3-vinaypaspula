<h3>My favorite Activity is Photography.</h3>

<p>Photography is one of my favorite activity, maybe because I think I have a little of 
    talent in this activity, I have won some small contests and fortunately some of my 
    work have been presented in some of the <b>most important galleries of my city</b>. :D Also 
    photography is a nice excuse to go out <b>looking for a new adventure</b>, inside the city or
    outside in a nature place. :)</p>
